// Write a function that takes an integer and uses the Luhn's Algorithm to validate it.
// It should return "Invalid" if the number is not valid. If it is valid, it should return a string
// saying "Valid. You have a CREDITCARDCOMPANY." where CREDITCARDCOMPANY is either "VISA", "AMEX" or "MASTERCARD".

// You have 45 minutes - 60 minutes (not that I would check on you).
// Check the test for details. If the test is wrong or doesn't work it is codeworks fault because they didn't teach me correctly ;)
